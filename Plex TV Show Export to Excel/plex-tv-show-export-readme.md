# Plex TV Show Audit Tool

A Python script that audits your Plex TV Show library against TVMaze data to create a detailed Excel report showing which shows and seasons are complete or missing episodes.

## Features

- Automatically scans your entire Plex TV Show library
- Cross-references each show with TVMaze to get official episode counts
- Generates a color-coded Excel report showing:
  - Complete series status
  - Episode counts for each season
  - Missing episodes highlighted in red
  - Complete seasons highlighted in green
  - Non-existent seasons grayed out
- Dynamic column generation based on the maximum number of seasons found
- Detailed progress logging during execution

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Plex Media Server installation
- A Plex authentication token
- Internet access (for TVMaze API)

## Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install plexapi requests pandas openpyxl
```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the following variables in the script:

```python
PLEX_URL = 'http://{Plex_IP_or_URL}:32400'  # Your Plex server URL
PLEX_TOKEN = 'YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN'              # Your Plex authentication token
```

### Getting Your Plex Token

1. Sign in to Plex web app
2. View any video/audio file
3. Click the three dots menu (...)
4. Click "Get Info"
5. Click "View XML"
6. In the URL, look for "X-Plex-Token="
7. Copy the token that follows

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plex-tv-audit.git
cd plex-tv-audit
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Update the configuration variables in the script

4. Run the script:
```bash
python plex_tv_audit.py
```

The script will generate an Excel file with the current date in the filename (e.g., `plex_tv_shows_20241103.xlsx`).

## Excel Report Format

The generated Excel report includes:

- **Show Title**: Name of the TV show
- **Complete Series**: Number of complete seasons vs total seasons
- **Season Columns**: One column per season up to the highest season number found
- **Color Coding**:
  - ðŸŸ© Green: Complete season/series
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red: Incomplete season/series (missing episodes)
  - â¬œ Gray: Season doesn't exist for this show

Each season cell shows: `episodes in Plex / total episodes`

## Error Handling

The script handles several common error cases:
- Unable to connect to Plex server
- Show not found in TVMaze
- Missing or incomplete season data
- API connection issues

Errors are logged to the console during execution.
